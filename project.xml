  <description>
    The RMMCI module consists of two parts: the 'rmmci-server' and the 'rmmci-client'. The server needs to be included in MMBase if you want clients to connect to MMBase using RMI: this way you can write java clients that talk to a central MMBase server as if they are running MMBase locally. Ideal for creating small client-side applications that need to talk to a shared repository.
